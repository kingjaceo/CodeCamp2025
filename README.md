# Code Camp 2025

## Who?
High school and middle school students are invited to participate. Students of all backgrounds are welcome: those who have never coded in their lives, and those who have taken several years of coding classes.

## What?
This is a two-week, summer coding camp designed for students for all levels: no coding experience whatsoever through AP- or college-level experience.

## When?
June 23 to July 5 or June 16 to June 27

## Where?
Briggs Hall, Rhodes College

## Content
There will be 2 tracks of content, one for total beginners and one for those with some experience. Both tracks will be project-based, self-directed learning with support from faculty and student assistants.

### Track 1: Total Beginner
Projects start very simple and grow in complexity, moving through topics in computer science including:
* variables
* operators
* functions
* graphics
* loops

### Track 2: With Experience
These students will pursue a singular, "large" project for the duration of the camp, covering topics including:
* simple data structures
* good design principles
* version control (eg, Git)
* project management
* working with a group

Students will also learn life skills, including:
* Critical thinking
